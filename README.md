# MyRoomShootingSim

This is a basic FPS using objects pooling for both the bullets and the targets for optimization towards VR usage.
I will use this to make my own VRHome settup with my room modeled to scale, but for now it's a fun aim training infinite target fps.

I will add options to customize the gun settings, just need to make the menu since the code is done. If you want to experiment with it you can download it and change the settings in the Unity Inspector of the gun. Burst Fire, bullets per second, etc... are available for change.
